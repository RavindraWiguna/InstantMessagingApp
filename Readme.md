## Tasks

Develop an instant messaging client AND server that have these features:

1. Messages are exchanged as Java objects, so you HAVE TO use object serialisation.
2. Users can log in to the system BEFORE they can send messages. Users only need to enter a username. Passwords are not needed.
3. Users can see other online users. It can be either in real-time or by request from the client app. (Salah satu boleh)
4. Users can send private messages to other users.
   Users can send broadcast messages to all online users, including themselves.
5. The communication is encrypted using SSL (optional). If you would like to implement this one, several steps are needed to set up the server-side application.
